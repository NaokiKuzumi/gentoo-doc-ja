"The best way to see the benefits of dynamic firewall scripts is to see them in\n"
"action. To do this, let's imagine that I'm a sysadmin at an ISP, and I've\n"
"recently set up a Linux-based firewall to protect my customers and internal\n"
"systems from malicious users on the Internet. To do this, my firewall uses the\n"
"new Linux 2.4 iptables stateful functionality to allow new outgoing connections\n"
"to be established by my customers and servers, and of course to allow new\n"
"incoming connections, but only to \"public\" services, such as web, ftp, ssh, and\n"
"SMTP. Since I used a deny-by-default design, any from-Internet connections to\n"
"non-public services, such as the squid proxy cache or Samba server, are\n"
"automatically rejected. So far, I have a pretty decent firewall that offers a\n"
"good level of protection for everyone at my ISP.\n"
