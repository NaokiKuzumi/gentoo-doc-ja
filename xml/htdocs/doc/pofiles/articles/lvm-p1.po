"(Logical Volume Management) and shows you how to get the latest kernel patches\n"
"and tools installed on your system. LVM allows you to create logical volumes\n"
"out of the physical storage resources on your machine. However, unlike physical\n"
"volumes, the logical volumes can be expanded and shrunk while the system is\n"

"Now, let's take a look at how LVM solves these problems. To create an LVM\n"
"logical volume, we follow a three-step process. First, we need to select the\n"
"physical storage resources that are going to be used for LVM. Typically, these\n"
"are standard partitions but can also be Linux software RAID volumes that we've\n"
"created. In LVM terminology, these storage resources are called \"physical\n"
"volumes\". Our first step in setting up LVM involves properly initializing these\n"
"partitions so that they can be recognized by the LVM system. This involves\n"
"setting the correct partition type if we're adding a physical partition, and\n"
"running the pvcreate command.\n"

"Once we have one or more physical volumes initialized for use by LVM, we can\n"
"move on to step two -- creating a volume group. You can think of a volume group\n"
"as a pool of storage that consists of one or more physical volumes. While LVM\n"
"is running, we can add physical volumes to the volume group or even remove\n"
"them. However, we can't mount or create filesystems on a volume group directly.\n"
