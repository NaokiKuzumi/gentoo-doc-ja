"My second organizational tip will help your backups go more smoothly. If you\n"
"are going to regularly back up a portion of your file system tree, it's a very\n"
"good idea to place this data on a separate partition. Why? Because many copying\n"
"and archiving tools have a special option for not crossing partition boundaries\n"
"(such as <c>cp</c>'s <c>-x</c> option), which will make it easy to select only\n"
"the files you want. Also, you can select a size for this partition so that it\n"
"is close to capacity of your backup media. That way, you'll never have to worry\n"
"about filling up a tape, and you can monitor how close you are to filling up\n"
"your backup media by using the <c>df</c> command to see how much space is left\n"
"on that particular partition. Then, you can track your storage and backup needs\n"

"At the beginning of this article, I mentioned all the fancy new journaled\n"
"filesystems now available for Linux. Amid all the excitement, it's easy to\n"
"forget our old friend, the ext2 filesystem. ext2 does have some drawbacks; it\n"
"is not extremely robust, for example. However, one thing it does excel at\n"
"(especially when compared to Microsoft's NTFS) is keeping fragmentation to a\n"
"minimum. If you don't know, file fragmentation occurs when there is not enough\n"
"contiguous space on a filesystem to store an entire file. The result? The file\n"
"is broken into non-contiguous \"fragments,\" which are stored on disk. When this\n"
"file is accessed, the hard drive's head needs to jump all over the place to\n"
"read in the entire file. This slows down I/O, adding additional seeks to the\n"
"reading process.\n"

"OK, you may ask, what's the big deal? After all, ext2 filesystems take a long\n"
"time to exhibit signs of fragmentation. However, I would argue that\n"
"fragmentation is still a big problem, because although ext2 does not get\n"
"fragmented easily, fragmentation is a one-way, cumulative process. That is,\n"
"while ext2 fragments slowly, it cannot defragment itself. In other words, any\n"
"often-modified ext2 filesystem will gradually get more and more fragmented, and\n"
"thus slower. Even worse, there are no production-quality ext2 filesystem\n"
"defragmenting programs currently available. This means that fragmentation is\n"
"guaranteed to get worse over time, and the only way to fix it is to wipe the\n"
"filesystem clean, and restore all the original files from a backup. That's a\n"
"pretty involved and time-consuming process. So, how can the problem of\n"
"fragmentation be dramatically reduced and contained? I'll cover all the juicy\n"
"details in my next tip. See you then!\n"
