"Samba's printer-sharing abilities come in handy and work well. To refresh your\n"

"clients can connect and print to them. One of the wonderful things about this\n"
"arrangement is that all printer-specific code is generated on the Windows side.\n"
"This means that your Unix system does not need to have explicit support for a\n"

"printer, it will work and work well. This even allows you to share and use\n"
