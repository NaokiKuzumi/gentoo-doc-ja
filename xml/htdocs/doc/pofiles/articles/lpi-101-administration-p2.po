"prepare you for the Linux Professional Institute's 101 exam. In this tutorial,\n"
"we'll show you how to use regular expressions to search files for text\n"
"patterns. Next, we'll introduce you to the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FSH),\n"
"and then show you how to locate files on your system. Then, we'll show you how\n"
"to take full control of Linux processes by running them in the background,\n"
"listing processes, detaching processes from the terminal, and more. Next, we'll\n"
