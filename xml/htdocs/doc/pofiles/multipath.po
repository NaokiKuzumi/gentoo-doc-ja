"Multipathing services, generally deployed in enterprise environments, provide a\n"
"means for high performance, load-balanced, and fault-tolerant data storage\n"
"either locally or via a storage area network (SAN). Multipathing facilitates a\n"
"single storage device to be transparently accessed across one or more paths.\n"
"For example, if there are two connections from a server Host Bus Adapter (HBA)\n"
"to two Fibre Channel switches and then to a SAN, when the HBA module loads and\n"
"scans the bus, it will read four paths to the SAN: the paths from the server HBA\n"
"to and from each Fibre Channel switch and at the storage device. Taking\n"
"advantage of this situation, Multipath allows you to make use of each path\n"
"simultaneously or independently to ensure a constant and reliable connection to\n"
"the data in storage. Multipath serves as a failover for all connections points\n"
"in the event of losing one path making critical data always available due to\n"
"redundancy in the design and implementation.\n"

"In the most basic sense, multipathing is made of two distinct parts:\n"
"<c>device-mapper</c> and <c>multipath-tools</c>. <b>Device Mapper</b> is the\n"
"first key element of this application. Administrators are probably familiar with\n"
"Device Mapper from LVM, EVMS, dm-crypt, or in this case, Multipath. In short,\n"
"working within the kernel space Device Mapper takes one block device such as\n"
"<path>/dev/sda</path> (as all SAN based targets will be some type of SCSI\n"
"device) and maps it to another device.\n"

"<b>Multipath Tools</b> is a set of userspace tools that interacts with the\n"
"Device Mapper tools and creates structures for device handling, implementing I/O\n"
"multipathing at the OS level. In a typical SAN environment, you will have\n"
"multiple paths to the same storage device: a fiber card (or two) on your server\n"
"that connects to a switch which then connects to the actual storage itself (as\n"
"in the scenario discussed above). So administrators could possibly see the same\n"
"device one to four times in such a situation (each card will see the LUN twice,\n"
"once for each path it has available to it). Thus, a single drive could be\n"
"recognized as <path>sda</path>, <path>sdb</path>, <path>sdc</path>, and\n"
"<path>sdd</path>. If you were to mount <path>/dev/sda</path> to\n"
"<path>/san1</path>, for instance, you would be going over the singular path from\n"
"one fiber card to a switch and then to a port on the same storage device. If any\n"
"of those points were to fail, you would lose your storage device suddenly and\n"
"have to unmount and remount with another device (<path>sdb</path>).\n"
